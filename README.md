# theCoderGames 2025

theCoderGames is a nationwide coding contest hosted by theCoderSchool. 

The games will be held from February 24, 2025 - March 9, 2025.

## Tips

- In the typed language bracket, use repl.it or any other suitable IDE. Once your code is ready to submit, copy and paste your code into our solution box. And make sure to always hit submit.
- Input / Output
  - Python: For input, create your own data structure like a list or integer variable and run your solution on that. For output, use `print()`.
  - JavaScript: For input, create your own data structure like a list or integer variable and run your solution on that. For output, use `console.log()`.
  - Java: For input, create your own data structure like a list or integer variable and run your solution on that. For output, use `System.out.println()`.
  - C#: For input, create your own data structure like a list or integer variable and run your solution on that. For output, use `System.Console.WriteLine();`.
  - C++: For input, create your own data structure like a list or integer variable and run your solution on that. For output, use `cout`.
  
## Rules

- We recommend teams of two, although solo teams or teams of 3 are also acceptable. Teams are scored the same way, regardless of team size. All team members must be current theCoderSchool students.
- Each team gets 45 minutes to complete as many code challenges as possible. Challenges are worth different points and can be solved in any order, but not all will be solved in time (so choose wisely!).
- All team members must participate during a coaching session with a coach monitoring.
- This challenge is purely about logic. Code readability, cool images/sprites, error handling, efficiency, etc won't be counted as part of this challenge.
- Your Coach is your referee. They may only help you set up your workspace and get started; other than that, you're on your own.
- You are free to Google commands, syntax, or code snippets (e.g., how to read input), but not full solutions.
- All solutions must be coded in either Scratch, Python, Javascript, C#, C++, or Java.
- Hard-coding is not allowed.
- Students can only enter one time. If a student enters into one bracket that is their one time and they will not be able to enter into the other bracket, so pick your bracket wisely, and then go for it!
